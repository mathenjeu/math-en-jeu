d$)$ $2\,027\,651\,281$\\

Answer : d$)$\\

Feedback : \\
It is $2\,027\,651\,281$. Given an odd composite number $n$, 
this test consists of using the fact that there exists positive integers
$a$ and $b$ like $n=a^2\,-\,b^2$, in which case $n=(a\,-\,b)(a\,+\,b)$ delivers a factorization of $n$.
It is an efficient method if the integer $n$ has two relatively close divisors. In Fermat's example, 
he first calculated $[\sqrt{
2\,027\,651\,281}]=45\,029$. He started with
$a=45\,029\,+\,1=45\,030$; since
$45\,030^2\,-\,2\,027\,651\,281=49\,619$ is not a perfect square,
he went on to $a=45\,031$, which still doesn't give a perfect square, 
and so on and so forth, until he got to $a=45\,041$, which gives
$b=\sqrt{45\,041^2\,-\,2\,027\,651\,281}=\sqrt{1\,040\,400}=1020$.
Then he could conclude that
$$n=2\,027\,651\,281=45\,041^2\,-\,1020^2=(45\,041\,-\,1020)(45\,041\,+\,1020)=44\,021\cdot46\,061.$$

that each had come to these results independently, although
Newton attained them a little earlier then Leibniz. However, this
controversy had for consequence of separating the world of mathematicians in two
: the ones from the continent (including the Bernoulli brothers) were on
Leibniz's side, whereas the English were defending Newton. The
consequence was that the English and the Continental mathematicians
stopped exchanging with one another. In the end, the big losers in
all of this were the English, since they stuck, for almost a century,
to Newton's geometrical approach, whereas the remainder of Europe took
advantage of Leibiz's analytical methods, which
turned out to be much more efficient.

It is easy to demonstrate that $B_1=-\frac12$ and that
$B_3=B_5=B_7=\ldots=0$. In fact, if we have
$$\displaystyle{f(x)=\frac
x{e^x\,-\,1}=B_0\,+\,B_1x\,+\,B_2\frac{x^2}{2!}\,+\,B_3\frac{x^3}{3!}\,+\,\ldots,}$$
then
$$\displaystyle{f(-x)=\frac{xe^x}{e^x\,-\,1}=B_0\,-\,B_1x\,+\,B_2\frac{x^2}{2!}\,-\,B_3\frac{x^3}{3!}\,+\,\ldots,}$$
with the result that
$$\displaystyle{f(x)\,-\,f(-x)=2B_1x\,+\,2B_3\frac{x^3}{3!}\,+\,2B_5\frac{x^5}{5!}\,+\,\ldots}$$
However, since $f(x)\,-\,f(-x)=-x$, it follows, by identification of
coefficients, that $B_1=-\frac12$ and that $B_{2n\,+\,1}=0$ for each
integer $n\ge1$. On the other hand, a direct calculation shows that
$B_2=\frac16$, $B_4=-\frac1{30}$, $B_6=\frac1{42}$,
$B_8=-\frac1{30}$, $B_{10}=\frac5{66}$, $B_{12}=-\frac{691}{2730}$,

The expression $\int_0^1x^xdx$ has a value of
$1-\frac1{2^2}\,+\,\frac1{3^3}-\frac1{4^4}\,+\,\ldots$ This result
