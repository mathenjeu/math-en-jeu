Answer : a$)$\\

Feedback:\\
Each unit of the map scale, represents a distance of 500 km and both locations are on the same vertical scale.There are four horizontal units between the pirate and the stronghold. Therefore, you need to multiply $4\times500$ to get the distance between the two. \\
The correct answer is a).\\
\\
\\
8011-- After he had plundered a few towns, Sev Enthsee the pirate drew a map of the Caribbean sea. The axes of the map give information about the distance in kilometres.

Sev Enthsee is now at the location marked by a black X . He left Cuba a few days ago where he stole a treasure map. He sent his long-distance parrot to scout the location of the treasure, marked with a red X . Considering the information indicated on the map, what is the distance that the parrot will have to travel if it flies to the treasure and back to the ship? (The ship will not move until the parrot is back).\\

a) 200 km\\
b) 500 km\\
c) 5,000 km\\
d) 30,000 km\\

Answer : c$)$\\

Feedback:\\
Each unit on the axes represents 500 km. Between the two positions, there are four horizontal units and three vertical units. The parrot will travel on the hypotenuse of a right triangle for which the edges are of three units and four units long. In order to find the length of the hypotenuse, calculate $3²+4²=25$ and $\sqrt{25} = 5$\\You then have to multiply $5\times500$ km to find the distance between the pirate and the treasure, which is 2,500 km.  But remember, the parrot also has to come back! Therefore, you need to multiply $2\times2,500$ km to get a total distance of 5,000 km.\\
The correct answer is c).\\

Feedback :\\
To find the area of a triangle, you must multiply the base by the height, and then divide by 2. The area of a rectangle of 4 m by 5 m would be 20 m$²$ but this triangle is half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height. Divide 20m$²$ by two and you find that 10 m$²$ is the area of the triangle. \\

a) All the angles are acute angles.\\
b) If one of the sides is 10 cm long, the perimeter of the triangle is 30 cm.\\
c) Its area is less than 1 m$²$.\\
d) With four identical triangles, we could build a polyhedron.\\

Answer : c$)$\\

Feedback :\\
If all the angles have equal measures in a triangle, the triangle is equilateral, which means its side all have the same length, and all the angles are $60°$ (acute angles). Such triangles can form a tetrahedron, a polyhedron with four triangular faces. The length of each side can be huge, so you can't know the area of this triangle.\\
The correct answer is c$)$.\\

b) The area of this triangle is 96 cm$²$.\\
c) The other side's length is 30 cm.\\
d) This triangle could be a face of a triangular prism.\\

Answer : c$)$\\

Feedback :\\
A triangle with a $90°$ angle is a right triangle. To find the area of a triangle, multiply the base by the height, and then divide by 2. $12\times16=192$ and $192\div2=96$ . Any triangle can be a face of a triangular prism . The length of its hypotenuse, the third side, can be calculated. $12²+16²=400$ and $\sqrt{400}=20$. The hypotenuse is 20 cm long, not 30 cm.\\

c) A triangle can have three unequal angles.\\
d) A triangle can have two right angles.\\

Answer : d$)$\\

d) Where's Waldo?\\
\\
Answer : a$)$\\
\\
Feedback :\\
It is possible to take a census of a group of students to find out how many of them have dishwashers at home. You then use the answers to create a pie chart for which one of the sections corresponds to the number of students that have dishwashers, and the other section corresponds to the number of those who don't have one. The whole disk represents the entire class. You can't get such results from the other questions.  \\
The answer is a$)$.\\

d) What method of transportation do doctors from St. Paul's hospital in Vancouver take to go to work?\\
\\
Answer : c$)$\\
\\
Feedback :\\
The amount of data corresponds to the number of people who give an answer to the question. To find out the favorite color of every single Canadian, you would need to take a census of more than 30,000,000 people. That's more people than in any of the other situations.\\

Feedback :\\
The bars of the diagram represent categories of answers. Question b) would gather a lot of data, but the number of different languages is limited. For question d), each month of each year will have a bar representing the amount of precipitations, for a total of more than a thousand bars (the number of months since 1920).\\
