Water is flowing into Len's basement at a rate of 50 litres per hour. Len can bail the water out at a rate of 60 litres per hour. If the water has been flowing in for two hours before Len begins bailing, how many hours will it take him to bail out all the water from his basement?\\

%	\includegraphics[width=30mm,viewport=]{CCJ78-04}
%\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{The correct answer is (E): 10}\\[1 ex]
In the two hours before Len starts bailing, 100 litres will have flowed into the basement. Thus the amount of water that has flowed into the basment at some time $t$ after Len starts bailing (just the flow in, not the amount removed) is $100+50t$ litres.

Len bails water at 60 litres per hour, so a time $t$ after he starts bailing, Len has bailed $60t$ litres of water. Setting the flow in equal to the flow out, we have
\begin{align*}
100+50t&=60t\\
t&=10.
\end{align*}
Therefore he has bailed out all the water 10 hours after starting.

1999 doesn't work. The next number that doesn't have two zeros in it is 2011, but this doesn't work either (not divisible by two or zero). 2012, however does work (it is divisible by 2 and 2 and 1).

Yesterday at least 90\% of the students in a certain class showed up for school. Today it snowed, and at most 75\% of the students in the class showed up. There were 6 fewer students in class today than yesterday. What is the largest possible number of students in the class?\\

%	\includegraphics[width=30mm,viewport=]{CCJ78-04}
%\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{The correct answer is (B): 40}\\[1 ex]
Assume exactly $75\%$ of the students show up today. Then $90\%-75\%=15\%$ of the class is equal to 6 students, and each student accounts for $\frac{15\%}{6}=\frac{5\%}{2}$. Therefore there are $\frac{100\%}{\frac{5\%}{2}}=40$ students total in the class.

This is the largest amount of students possible because the maximum number of students occurs when we minimize the percent of the class that each student accounts for. This is done by minimizing the difference between the percentage of students who make it on yesterday and the percentage who make it today, thus $75\%$ today.

The volume of the oil on the water must equal the volume of the oil before it enters the water, thus letting $t$ be the thickness of the oil, we have
\begin{align*}
1000mm\times2000mm\times t&=1000mm^3\\
t&=\frac{1}{2000}mm.

Lets factor 1998: $\frac{1998}{2}=999$, $\frac{999}{3}=111$, $\frac{111}{3}=37$, and 37 is prime, thus 37 is the largest prime factor.

\textbf{The correct answer is (D): $\frac{4}{9}$}\\[1 ex]
The ratio of $BC$ to $AB$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, thus the ratio of $DF$ to $AD$ is also $\frac{1}{2}$. Also, because $BDFE$ is a square, $BD=DF$. Therefore, \begin{align*}
\frac{DF}{2-BD}&=\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{BD}{2-BD}&=\frac{1}{2}\\
2BD&=2-BD\\
BD&=\frac{2}{3}.
\end{align*}
Thus the area of the square is $BD^2=\frac{4}{9}$.

\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{The correct answer is (C): $6750+\frac{225\pi}{2}\textbf{m}^2$}\\[1 ex]
The radius of the semicircle is 15m, thus $BD=15$m and $FE=15$m.  Therefore the height of the triangle is $FH=250-215-15=20$m, and the area of the triangle is 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}\times30\times20=300.
\end{equation*}
The area of the semicircle is $\frac{1}{2}\pi(15)^2$ and the area of the rectangle is $215\times30=6450$. Therefore the area of the deck is 
\begin{equation*}
300+\frac{225\pi}{2}+6450=6750+\frac{225\pi}{2}\textbf{m}^2.

Bruce is running a 10km race. He runs one km at 30km/h, but then walks 1/2km at 5km/h. He then runs 1km (again at 30km/h), and walks 1/2 km (again at 5km/h), and continues alternating in this fashion until he finishes the race. If Bruce were to run at a constant speed for the entire 10km distance, how fast would he have to run in order to finish the race in the same amount of time as it takes using his current strategy?\\

(A) 8km/h\\

(B) 10km/h\\

%	\includegraphics[width=30mm,viewport=]{CCJ78-04}
%\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{The correct answer is (C): 12km/h}\\[1 ex]
It takes Bruce 2 minutes to run 1km, and 6 minutes to walk 1/2km. To get to 10km, Bruce uses the pattern:
\begin{equation*}
1+\frac{1}{2}+1+\frac{1}{2}+1+\frac{1}{2}+1+\frac{1}{2}+1+\frac{1}{2}+1+\frac{1}{2}+1.
\end{equation*}
Thus the whole race takes him
\begin{equation*}
2+6+2+6+2+6+2+6+2+6+2+6+2=50\textrm{minutes}.
\end{equation*}
Thus he needs to run at $\frac{60}{50}\times10=12$km/h to finish in the same amount of time.

\textbf{The correct answer is (D): 1/6}\\[1 ex]
In the picture, F, G, and H are the three houses, and X is where Farah is when she is halfway to Heidi's house. So FX and XH are the same length. Since Farah is now 2/3 of the way to G, FX must be twice as lon as XG, so XG is 1/4 of the whole length FH. Thus GH is also 1/4 of FH. Now let Y be where Heidi is when she is 2/3 of the way to G. Then HY must be 2/3 of 1/4 of FH, which is 1/6 of the way to Farah's house.

\textbf{The correct answer is (B): $2\sqrt{2}$}\\[1 ex]
Label the picture as shown, where O is the center of the square and octagon. OC is given by the Pythagorus theorem, OC=$\sqrt{3^2+3^2}=3\sqrt{2}$. 

Because CBA and CBD are 45-45-90 triangles, BC=BA=BD. And by Pythagorus, DD=$\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\sqrt{2}$, thus BC=$\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, OB=OC-BC=$2\sqrt{2}$, and thus the radius of the largest circle that can be drawn inside of the octagon is $2\sqrt{2}$.

\textbf{The correct answer is (C): 31}\\[1 ex]
We are told that 5 more students were present yesterday than today. To maximize the number of students in the class, we must minimize the percentage of the total class that the 5 students account for. Therefore, we want to minimize the difference between the percent that was here yesterday and the percent that was here today. So set the percentage that was here yesterday to be $90\%$ and the percent here today to be $75\%$. Then 5 students is $15\%$ of the class, and the class has $5\frac{1}{.15}=33\frac{1}{3}$.

At this point it looks like the correct answer is 33 students, but this is \textbf{wrong}. More than $90\%$ of 33 is at least 30, and less than $75\%$ is at most 24, so the minimum difference is 6 students not 5. Similarly 32 students doesn't work either. Thus 31 is the maximum number of students.
