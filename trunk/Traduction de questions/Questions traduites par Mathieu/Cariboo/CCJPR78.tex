An approximate value of $\dfrac{31.78\sqrt{2600}}{(3.98)^3}$ is:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]
%ChoiceA

%ChoiceD
	\item 56
%ChoiceE
	\item 150
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (C): 25}

The idea is to split each number into components that can be more easily calculated. Hence
\begin{align*}
\frac{31.78\sqrt{2600}}{(3.98)^3} &= \frac{31.78\sqrt{26\times100}}{(3.98)^3} = \frac{31.78\times 10\sqrt{26}}{(3.98)^3}\\
&\approx \frac{32\times10\sqrt{25}}{4^3} = \frac{32\cdot10\cdot5}{64} = \frac{10\cdot5}{2} = 25

\textbf{The correct answer is (D): 48}

If the quarter circle at the bottom were moved to the quarter circular space at the top, a rectangle would be formed.

The top side of the rectangle has length $AB$ plus the radius of the quarter circle. Since $AB=2$ and the radius of the quarter circle is 4, this side has length 6.

The right side of the rectangle is twice the radius of the quarter circle, or $2 \times 4 = 8$.

Hence the area of the rectangle is $8 \times 6 =48$.

2 pens cost the same as 3 pencils. A customer bought 1 pen and 1 pencil. The clerk said, ``The total of the digits of what you owe is 12.'' The number of cents, in change, that the customer receives from a dollar bill is:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm, leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]

%ChoiceD

%ChoiceE
	\item none of these
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (B): 25}

Let $p=$ cost of a pencil, and $P=$ cost of a pen. 2 pens cost the same as 3 pencils, so $2P=3p$ and $P=\frac{3}{2}p$. Then a pencil and a pen cost $C=p+\frac{3}{2}p=\frac{5}{2}p$.

Assuming both $p$ and $P$ are whole numbers, $C=\frac{5}{2}$ has to be divisible by 5, meaning $C$ ends in a 0 or a 5. The two digits add to 12, so the digits of $C$ are either $12+0$ (impossible in base 10) or 7$+5$.

So $C=75$ cents and the customer gets 25 cents change from a dollar.

\textbf{The correct answer is (C): $\mathbf{2a+4\frac{1}{2}c}$}

Recall that all isosceles right triangles are similar. Since the hypotenuse of $b$ is $2\times$ the hypotenuse of $a$, the other two sides of $b$ will be $2\times$ the corresponding sides of $a$. Thus $b=4a$.

Similarly we find that $b=9c$. Adding the two equations together we get:
\begin{align*}
2b&=4a+9c\\
b&=2a+4\tfrac{1}{2}c.

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (E): 88}

Let c be the total number of cars on Al's lot. 20\% of these are red, so there are $0.2\,c$ red cars.

Then 60\% of those are '77 models, so there are $0.6(0.2\,c) = 0.12\,c$ red '77 cars. We know there are 12 of those, so
\[
c = \frac{12}{0.12} = 12 \div \frac{12}{100} = 12 \times \frac{100}{12} = 12 \times \frac{25}{3} = 4 \times 25 = 100.
\]
Since 12 of the cars on the lot are red '77 models, $100-12=88$ cars are not red '77 models.

\textbf{The correct answer is (B): $\mathbf{16\sqrt{2}}$}

Let $l_n$ be the length of the sides of the $n^\text{th}$ largest square. Consider one of the outermost right triangles. It has two legs of length $l_1/2$, so the hypotenuse $l_2$ is
\[
l_2 = \sqrt{2} \times \frac{l_1}{2} = l_1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Repeat 4 times for successive squares:
\[
l_6 =  l_1 \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^5 = \frac{l_1}{4\sqrt{2}} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad l_1 = l_6 \times 4 \sqrt{2} 
\]
We know the area of the smallest square is 1, so $l_6=1$ and $l_1 = 4\sqrt{2}$. Then the perimeter of the largest square is $4\times 4\sqrt{2} = 16 \sqrt{2}$.

Imagine 100 lockers, all closed, and 100 students. Suppose the first student goes along and opens every locker. Then the second student goes along and shuts every second locker. Then the third student goes along and changes the state of every third locker (ie. if it is open, she shuts it, and vice versa). Then the fourth student goes along and changes the state of every fourth locker, etc. until all 100 students have passed by all lockers.

How many lockers will be open at the end?

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is 10}

A locker will be open only if its state is changed an odd number of times. If $x$ is the number of lockers, then the state of a locker will change once for every divisor of $x$ between 1 and $x$ itself, inclusive.

If $n$ is a divisor of $x$, then $x/n$ is also a divisor of $n$. Thus every divisor $x$ has another divisor $n/x$ paired with it, except where $x = n/x$. This only happens in perfect squares.

Thus every opening of a locker is eventually canceled by a closing, except in perfect square lockers. Since $10^2=100$, there are ten perfect squares between 1 and 100. Hence 10 lockers will be open after the $100^\text{th}$ student goes by.

When Antonino goes fishing, he finds that on the trip from his home to the lake his jeep uses 10 km/L of gas, but on the return trip it uses 15 km/L of gas. If he uses 2 L of gas for the entire trip, the distance, in km, of the lake from his home must be:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (D): 12}

Let $d$ be the distance from the home to the lake, $l_1$ be the litres of gas used on the way to the lake, and $l_2$ be the litres of gas used on the way back.

On the way to the lake, Antonino burns 10 L of gas for every km. So $l_1 = d/10$.
On the way back home, Antonino burns 15 L of gas for every km. So $l_2 = d/15$.

In total Antonino burns 2 L of gas, so $2 = l_1 + l_2 = d \left(\dfrac{1}{10}+\dfrac{1}{15}\right)$ and
\[
d = \frac{2}{1/10 + 1/15} = \frac{60}{3+2} = 12.

$P$ is the midpoint of one side of a rectangle which is twice as long as it is wide, and which has a perimeter of 24. The radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $PCD$ is approximately:

\end{wrapfigure}
\textbf{The correct answer is (D): $\mathbf{1\frac{2}{3}}$}

Let $r$ be the radius of the circle, and $l$ be the length of the rectangle. The width of the rectangle will then be $l/2$. Since the perimeter is 24, we have
\[
24 = 2 \left(l+\frac{l}{2}\right) = 3l \quad \Longrightarrow \quad l=8.
\]
Now the triangle $PCD$ has height 4. Consider a perpendicular from $P$ down to $CD$, and a radius of the circle from the centre $O$ to $PC$, meeting $PC$ at $E$. Then triangle $POE$ is a right triangle with $EP=EO=r$, from which we see that $PO=\sqrt{2}\;r$. The remaining distance from $O$ to $CD$ is $r$, so that
\begin{align*}
\text{width of the rectangle} = 4 = \sqrt{2}\;r+r = r(\sqrt{2}+1)\\
r = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}+1} \approx \frac{4}{14/10+1} = \frac{4}{24/10} = \frac{40}{24} = 1 \frac{2}{3}.

Let $r$ be the radius of the track used by the inner wheel. The inner wheel, then, travels $2\pi r$ metres per circuit. Since the outer wheel is 2 m away, it travels $2\pi(r+2)$ metres per circuit.

The outer wheel goes twice as fast so it makes 2 turns for every 1 turn of the inner wheel. Assuming the wheels have the same radius, the outer wheel travels twice as far as the inner wheel, so that
\begin{align*}
2\pi (r+2) &= 2\times 2\pi r\\
2\pi r + 4\pi &= 4\pi r\\
2r &= 4\\
r &= 2
\end{align*}
The outer wheel then travels $2\pi(2+2) = 8\pi$ m per circuit. Therefore, after 10 circuits, the outer wheel will have traveled $80\pi$ m.

If $n$ is an integer and $r$ is the smallest integer such that $252r = n^2$, then $r+n$ equals:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]
%ChoiceA
	\item 49
%ChoiceB
	\item 51
%ChoiceC
	\item 34
%ChoiceD
	\item 40
%ChoiceE
	\item 36
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (A): 49}

If $252r$ is to equal $n^2$, and $n$ is an integer, $252r$ must be a square. Factorization gives $252r = 2^2 3^3 7r$, so that the smallest possible value of $r$ is 7. In this case
\[
n^2 = 252\,r = 2^2\cdot3^3\cdot7^2 = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7)^2 = (42)^2
\]
so that $n=42$. Thus $r+n = 7+42 = 49$.

If $n$ and $s$ are positive integers, then the number of solutions of the equation $3n+2s=73$ is:

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (D): 12}

One possible solution is $(n,s)=(1,35)$. If $n$ and $s$ are to remain positive integers in the remaining solutions, $n$ must rise by 2 for every drop of 3 in $s$. In fact, all solutions $(n,s)$ must have the form $(1+2m,35-3m)$ for integer $m$.

The smallest allowed solution is then (23,2) for $m=11$. Thus there are 12 solutions in all.

A box is dragged along from $S$ to $F$, a distance of 7, by a weight attached to a rope which passes over a pulley at point $P$. If $PB = 12$ and $SB=16$, then the distance the weight moves is:

\end{wrapfigure}
\textbf{The correct answer is (D): 5}

The distance the weight moves is the difference in rope lengths between the line segments $SP$ and $FP$. Applying Pythagoras to the right triangle $SBP$, we find
\begin{align*}
(SP)^2 &= (SB)^2 + (BP)^2 = 16^2 + 12^2 = 400^2;\\
SP &= 20.
\end{align*}
Similarly, for triangle $FBP$ we find
\begin{align*}
(FP)^2 &= (FB)^2 + (BP)^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 = 225^2;\\
FP &= 15.
\end{align*}
Thus the distance the weight moves is $SP-FP=20-15=5$.

The times it takes three tireless boys, $A$, $B$, and $C$, to run around a circular track are 1/2 minute, 1 1/3 minutes, and 1 2/5 minutes respectively. If they are together at the starting line at noon, the number of minutes that pass before they will again all be at the starting line is:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]
%ChoiceA
	\item 4

%ChoiceD
	\item 56
%ChoiceE
	\item 60
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (B): 28}

Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the number of laps $A$, $B$, and $C$ have made, respectively, when all three are back at the starting line. The time that has passed will equal the number of laps that $A$ has made times the amount of time each lap takes, or $a\;\times$ 1/2 min. Similarly, the time will also equal $b\;\times$ 1 1/3 min and $c\;\times$ 1 2/5 min. Since they are all equal we have
\[
\frac{1}{2} a = \frac{4}{3} b = \frac{7}{5} c 
\]
Multiplying through by $2 \times 3 \times 5$, we get
\[
3 \times 5 \times a = 2^3 \times 5 \times b = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times c
\]
The lowest common multiple of these numbers is $2^3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7$, meaning that $a = 2^3 \times 7 = 56$. Hence $A$ will have made 56 laps when everyone is back at the starting line. This will take $56/2 = 28$ min.

\textbf{The correct answer is (E): $\mathbf{\sqrt{3} - \dfrac{\pmb{\pi}}{2}}$}

Note that a triangle drawn connecting the centres of the circles will be equilateral. The area of the shaded region, then, is the area of this triangle minus the area of the three circular sectors within it.

Since the triangle is equilateral each sector subtends a 60$^\circ$ angle. The area of each sector is
\[
\frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \pi 1^2 = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]
and the area of all three sectors is $3 \times \pi/6 = \pi/2$. The area of an equilateral triangle with base $b$ is $(\sqrt{3}/4)b^2$. Since $b = 2$ in our case, the area of our triangle is $\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the shaded region is $\sqrt{3} - \pi/2$.

Let $S_{2n}$ be the sum of all the positive integers from 1 to $2n$ inclusive. Then $S_{2n}$ is $S$ plus the sum of the integers from $n+1$ to $2n$. The sum of the integers from $n+1$ to $2n$ can be found by noticing that when we subtract $n$ from each of the $n$ values, we have left the sum from 1 to $n$, which is $S$. Thus
\[
S_{2n} = S+(n^2+S)=2S+n^2.

g(x) = (x+5) \div 3 = \frac{x+5}{3}.

The radius of each circle is 1. We are looking for the difference in height between $a$ and $a'$ in the diagram.

The height of $a$ is 3. Note that $a'bc$ is an equilateral triangle with base 2; hence its height is $2 \times \sin 60^{\circ} = \sqrt{3}$. The height of $a'$ is then $\sqrt{3}+1$.

The loss of height of the circle is $a-a'=3-\sqrt{3}+1=2-\sqrt{3}$.

Bill has 3 boxes with marbles in them. 24\% of the marbles in the first box are red. The second box contains twice as many marbles as the first, and 15\% of them are red. The third box contains 3 times as many marbles as the first box and 10\% of them are red. If Bill puts all the marbles into one box, then the percentage of red marbles in this box will be:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]
%ChoiceA
	\item 12
%ChoiceB
	\item 14
%ChoiceC
	\item 15
%ChoiceD
	\item $16 \frac{1}{3}$
%ChoiceE
	\item 49
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (B): 14\%}

Let $m$ be the number of marbles in the first box. Then the second and third boxes have 2$m$ and $3m$ marbles, respectively. In total there will be $6m$ marbles.

The first box has 24\% red marbles, so it has $0.24m$ of them.\\
The second box has 15\% red marbles, so it has $0.15\times2m = 0.3m$ of them.\\
The third box has 10\% red marbles, so it has $0.1\times3m= 0.3m$ of them.

The total number of red marbles is $0.24m+0.3m+0.3m = 0.84m$. This puts the percentage of red marbles at
\[
\frac{0.84m}{6m}\times100\% = 14\%.

The area of the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the unshaded region, or $24-(2\pi+4)=20-2\pi$.

What percentage of the first 4000 positive integers give a remainder of 5 when divided by 9?
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0mm,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]
%ChoiceA

%ChoiceB

	\item $11 \frac{1}{9}$
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (D): $\mathbf{11\frac{1}{10}}$}

The numbers that give 5 as a remainder when divided by 9 are 5, 14, 23, \ldots, \mbox{$5+9(n-1)$}. Since we are looking for numbers less than or equal to 4000, we must find $n$ such that
\begin{align*}
5+9(n-1) &\leq 4000\\
9(n-1) &\leq 3995\\
n-1 &\leq 443.88\ldots\\
n &\leq 444.88\ldots\\
n &\leq 444 &&(n\text{ is an integer.})
\end{align*}
Thus 444/4000 = 11.1\% of the first 4000 positive integers give a remainder of 5 when divided by 9.

The wheels on Antonino's bicycle have a diameter of 70 cm, while those on Bill's bicycle have a diameter of 63 cm. In a 1 km ride Bill's front wheel will make more revolutions that Antonino's front wheel. Approximately how many more?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0mm,leftmargin=*,widest=D,label=\Alph*)]
%ChoiceA
	\item 50
%ChoiceB
	\item 100
%ChoiceC
	\item 150
%ChoiceD
	\item 200
%ChoiceE
	\item 700
\end{enumerate}

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is (A): 50}

Each bicycle's wheels will travel the distance of one circumference for every revolution it makes. So Antonino's bicycle travels $70\pi$ cm = $0.7\pi$ m per revolution and Bill's bicycle travels $63\pi$ cm = $0.63\pi$ m per revolution. The total distance is 1 km = 1000 m, so the number of revolutions of each bicycle's wheels are given by

\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\[r_{\text{Ant}} = \frac{1000\text{ m}}{0.7\pi \text{ m}}\]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\[r_{\text{Bill}} = \frac{1000\text{ m}}{0.63\pi \text{ m}}\]
\end{minipage}

Therefore, Bill's wheel made
\begin{align*}
r_{\text{Bill}} - r_{\text{Ant}} &= \frac{1000}{0.7\pi} - \frac{1000}{0.63\pi} = \frac{1000}{\pi} \left(\frac{100}{63}-\frac{100}{70}\right)\\
&= \frac{100\;000}{7\pi}\left(\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{10}\right) = \frac{100\;000}{7\pi \times 90} = \frac{10\;000}{63\pi} \approx 50
\end{align*}
more revolutions than Antonino's.

\textbf{The correct answer is (B): $\mathbf{16-8\sqrt{2}}$}

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.6\textwidth}
Since the areas of $ABCDE$ and $FBCD$ are equal, the areas of the two triangle $ABG$ and $EFG$ are equal and they are congruent. Let $x=\overline{FG}=\overline{EF}$. Then $\overline{EG}=\overline{BG}=x\sqrt{2}$ by Pythagoras. Since $\overline{FG}+\overline{BG}=8$, we can get an equation to solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
x\sqrt{2}+x &= 8\\
x(\sqrt{2}+1) &= 8

\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.35\textwidth}

\[x = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}+1} = \frac{8(\sqrt{2}-1)}{(\sqrt{2}+1)(\sqrt{2}-1)} = 8\sqrt{2}-8.\]
The length of $ED$ is then $8-x=16-8\sqrt{2}$.

Consider triangle $OAB$ in the diagram, where $O$ is the centre of the concentric circles. This is a right triangle with hypotenuse $\sqrt{2}$ and height $1$, so that $\angle BOA = 45^{\circ}$. The length of arc $AB$ is then
\[
\frac{45^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}} \times 2\pi\sqrt{2} = \frac{\pi\sqrt{2}}{4}.
\]
Similarly, consider triangle $OCD$, which has hypotenuse 2 and height 1, giving $\angle DOC = 30^{\circ}$. The length of arc $CD$ is
\[
\frac{30^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}} \times 2\pi(2) = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
The ratio of the length of arc $AB$ to the length of arc $CD$ is
\[
\frac{\pi\sqrt{2}}{4}:\frac{\pi}{3} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 3\sqrt{2}:4.

A field yields 4 loads of grain per hectare while a second field yields 3 loads of grain per hectare. The yield of the first field was 12 loads more than the second. The area of the two fields together was 17 hectares. What is the difference in area between the fields, in hectares?

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is 1}

Let $A_1$ = area of first field, $A_2$ = area of second field.

The first field yields 4 loads of grain per hectare, or $4A_1$ loads in total. The second field yields 3 loads of grain per hectare, or $3A_2$ loads in total. The first field yields 12 loads more than the second, so
\[
4A_1 - 3A_2 = 12.
\]
We also know that $A_1 + A_2 = 17$ from the question. Multiply this equation by 3 and add to the previous equation to get $7A_1 = 63$, or $A_1 = 9$. Therefore $A_2 = 17-9 = 8$, and the difference between the area of the two fields is 1 hectare.

This is a problem similar to ones found in old Babylonian texts:

I have multiplied the length and width to obtain the area of a rectangle. Then I added to the area the excess of the length over the width and obtained 183 as a result. Moreover, I added the length and the width to get 27. Find the smallest possible area of the rectangle.

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is 180}

Let $l$ = width of rectangle, $w$ = width of rectangle.

We are given that the area plus the excess of the length over the width equals 183, and that the length plus width is 27:

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
	\centering
	$lw+(l-w)=183$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
	\centering
	$l+w=27$
\end{minipage}

Combining the equations and solving for $l$, we get
\begin{align*}
l(27-l)+[l-(27-l)] &= 183\\
l^2-29l+210 &= 0\\
(l-15)(l-14) &= 0,
\end{align*}
implying that either $l=15$ and $w=12$, or $l=14$ and $w=13$. The first case gives an area of 180; the second case gives an area of 182. Hence the smallest possible area of the rectangle is 180.

Imagine 1000 lockers, all closed, and 1000 students. Suppose the first student goes along and opens every locker. Then the second student goes along and shuts every second locker. Then the third student goes along and changes the state of every third locker (ie. if it is open, she shuts it, and vice versa). Then the fourth student goes along and changes the state of every fourth locker, etc. until all 1000 students have passed by all lockers.

How many lockers will be open at the end?

%Ftext
\textbf{The correct answer is 31}

A locker will be open only if its state is changed an odd number of times. If $x$ is the number of lockers, then the state of a locker will change once for every divisor of $x$ between 1 and $x$ itself, inclusive.

If $n$ is a divisor of $x$, then $x/n$ is also a divisor of $n$. Thus every divisor $x$ has another divisor $n/x$ paired with it, except where $x = n/x$. This only happens in perfect squares.

Thus every opening of a locker is eventually canceled by a closing, except in perfect square lockers. Since $31^2=963<1000$ and $32^2=1024>1000$, there are 31 perfect squares between 1 and 1000. Hence 31 lockers will be open after the $1000^\text{th}$ student goes by.

Consider the path $AB'$ shown.

Note that $AB'$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with height 3 and base 10. Using Pythagoras, we can see that
