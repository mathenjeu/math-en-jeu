R\'etroaction : \\
The final figure is larger than the initial figure. Therefore, the
homothety ratio has to be an enlargement factor. In other words, it
has to be larger than 1 or smaller than $-1$. Since whether or not
the two figures lie on the same side of the homothety center is not
stated in the question, the sign of the homothety ratio remains
unknown. Therefore, the answer is b).\\

first transformation, the figure \emph{F2} is twice as large as
\emph{F1}. Since \emph{F2} is subjected to an homothety of ratio 3
to become \emph{F3}, figure \emph{F3} is three times larger than
\emph{F2}, or six times larger than \emph{F1}. One simply needs to
take the product of the two homothety ratios. Therefore, the
answer is d).\\

R\'eponse : a)\\

R\'etroaction : \\
This problem deals with a composition of homotheties. After the
first homothety, the figure \emph{F2} is 1.8 times larger than
\emph{F1}. Figure \emph{F3} is twice as small as \emph{F2} because
it has been subjected to an homothety of ratio 0.5. Simple
arithmetic tells us that the
homothety ratio from \emph{F1} to \emph{F3} is 0.9. The answer is a).\\

$2.7$\,m $\times\,1.2=3.24$\,m\\

0.7\\

The area of the initial rectangle is 216\,cm$^{2}$.  After the
homothety, its size is 6\,cm by 9\,cm and its area is 54\,cm$^{2}$.

There are 10 possible choices in the units' position, \emph{i.e.} 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. There are also 10 possible choices in
the tens', hundreds' thousands', and ten thousands' positions.
However, the hundred thousands' position only has 9 possible choices because a 6 digit number cannot start with 0. Therefore, the are $9\times10\times10\times10\times10\times10=900,000$ 6 digit numbers and the answer is c).\\

R\'etroaction : \\
The probability to get the ace of spade in the first draw is
$\frac{1}{52}$. The probability to get an ace of diamond in the
second draw is $\frac{1}{51}$, because the card first drawn has not
been put back in the deck. Therefore, the joint probability of
drawing an ace of spade followed by an ace of diamond is
$\frac{1}{52}\times\frac{1}{51}=
\frac{1}{2652}$.\\
The answer is b).\\

R\'etroaction : \\
On his first draw, Tintin has a probability of 1 to draw a sock. On the second pick, there are only 19 socks left, one of which correctly pairing with the first pick. Thus, there is one chance out of 19 to pick it. The probability to pick a pair is $1\times\frac{1}{19}=\frac{1}{19}$. Therefore, the answer is d).\\
