611-- Which of the following four statements is true?\\

a) The total area ratio of two similar solids is half of the
similarity ratio of the two solids.\\
b) The total area ratio of two similar solids is equal to the similarity ratio
between two solids.\\
c) The total area ratio of two similar solids is equal to the square of the similarity
ratio between the two solids.\\
d) The total area ratio of two similar solids is equal to the cube of the similarity ratio between the two solids.\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation: \\
The total area ratio of two similar solids is equal to the square of the similarity ratio between the two solids.
Thus, the answer is c).\\

641-- What is the distribution mode of 1, 9, 12, 6, 3, 1, 4, 10, 9, 2,
11, 4, 7, 9, 3, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 6, 4, 7, 6, 2?\\

Answer: 6\\

Explanation: \\
Start by putting data in order.\\
1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11,
12\\
The distribution mode is the piece of data used with the highest number of occurrences. In this data set the number 6 is the most frequently occuring value. Thus, the mode is 6.\\

651-- What is the percentile rank of a piece of data that is $45\,\%$ superior to all data?\\

Answer: 55\\

Explanation: \\
If 45\,\% of all data is superior to this piece of data, then 55\,\% are smaller to or equal to this number. The percentile rank is a number that indicates the percentage of data smaller than or equal to the indicated data.  Thus, the correct answer is 55.\\

661-- Among the following four statements, which one is true?\\

a) The answer to $(-4)^{432}$ is negative.\\
b) The answer to $-4^{432}$ is negative.\\
c) The answer to $-(-4)^{432}$ is positive.\\
d) The answer to $(-4)^{433}$ is positive.\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation: \\
The answer to $-4^{432}$ is negative since only the number 4 is raised to the $432^{th}$ power. Even if $4^{432}$ is positive, the negative sign located in front of the number makes the overall result negative.\\
The correct answer is b).\\

If the product of four factors is zero, then at least one of these factors is zero.  \\
The correct answer is a).\\

691-- What value must $w$ have in order for $wx^{2}\,-\,24x\,+\,9$ to be a perfect square?\\

Answer: 16\\

Explanation: \\
$(4x\,-\,3)^{2}=16x^{2}\,-\,24x\,+\,9$\\
The correct answer is 16.\\

701-- Of the four choices below, which one represents $(f\,-\,g)(-4)$
if $f(x)=3x\,+\,4$ and $g(x)=x^{2}\,-\,2x\,+\,1$?\\

a) $-36$\\
b) $-33$\\
c) $-30$\\
d) $-27$\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation: \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(x)&=&3x\,+\,4\\
g(x)&=&x^{2}\,-\,2x\,+\,1\\
f(x)\,-\,g(x)&=&3x\,+\,4\,-\,(x^{2}\,-\,2x\,+\,1)\\
&=&3x\,+\,4\,-\,x^{2}\,+\,2x\,-\,1\\
&=&-x^{2}\,+\,5x\,+\,3\\
(f\,-\,g)(-4)&=& - (-4)^{2}\,+\,5\times(-4)\,+\,3\\
&=&-16\,-\,20\,+\,3\\
&=&-33\\
\end{eqnarray*}
The correct answer is b).\\

711-- Among the four following choices, which one is the image of 4 subject to the function $f(x)=(x\,-\,5)(x\,+\,3)$?\\

a) $-63$\\
b) $-7$\\
c) 7\\
d) 63\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation: \\
By replacing $x$ with 4 in the equation
$f(x)=(x\,-\,5)(x\,+\,3)$.\\
We obtain $f(4)=(4\,-\,5)(4\,+\,3)=(-1)(7)=-7$.\\
The correct answer is b).\\

721-- Among the four following choices, which one represents the interval where the function $f(x)=2x\,+\,7$ is decreasing?\\

a) $\varnothing$\\
b) $]-\infty,0]$\\
c) $[0,\infty[$\\

761-- How many cards must Frederick pull out of a normal deck of 52 cards to be sure of having at least 4 black cards?\\

Answer: 30\\

Explanation: \\
If Frederick is very unlucky, the first 26 cards he picks will be red and then the next four will be black. Thus, he must pick 26 + 4 = 30 cards. The correct answer is 30.\\

771-- Aladdin owns a magic lamp whose mass is 1/24 of Aladdin's weight. When he is carrying his lamp he weighs 75\,kg.  What is the mass in kilograms of the magic lamp?\\

Answer: 3\\

Explanation:\\
Let's say\\
$A$ = Aladdin's mass in kilograms; \\
$L$ = Lamp's mass in kilograms.\\

$A\,+\,L=75 \qquad $(equation 1)\\
$24L=A \qquad $ (equation 2)\\

From equation 1 $A$ is replaced with it's value calculated in equation 2.\\
$24L \,+\,L = 75$\\
$25L=75$\\
$L=3$\\
The lamp weighs 3\,kg.\\

1 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
2 & 1 & 2\\ \hline
3 & 2 & 4\\ \hline
4 & 3 & 6\\ \hline
5 & 4 & 8\\ \hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{}\\

\end{tabular}\\

After four days of travelling, the caterpillar has reached a heigth of 8 m. During the fifth day, it climbs four more meters and reaches the top or 12 m high.  Thus, the caterpillar must travel for 4 entire days to reach the wall's summit.
The correct answer is b).\\

801-- Philo wants to meet up with his girlfriend Sophie, but he doesn't want to be accompanied by his other friends. So, he gives Sophie a code card from which she can read $13\,-\,15\,-\,22\,-\,9\,-\,5\,-\,20\,-8\,-5\,-1\,-20\,-5\,-18$.

861-- How many different and discernable arrangements can be made with the letters in the word \sloppy \mbox{COMBINATION?}\\

a) $4\,989\,600$\\
b) $9\,979\,200$\\
c) $19\,958\,400$\\
d) $39\,916\,800$\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation: \\
The word COMBINATION contains 11 letters, 8 of which are not the same. N, I and O are each repeated twice.\\
If each letter was different in the word, there would be
$11!\,=11\times10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1=39\,916\,800$
arrangements.  However, the two N's, two I's and two O's are not detectable, thus diminishing the number of arrangements. Therefore, there are
$\frac{11!}{2!\,2!\,2!}=\frac{11\times10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{2\times1\times2\times1\times2\times1}=4\,989\,600$
different arrangements. The correct answer is a).\\

871-- Three of the following results are attributed to Thales of Miletos and Pythagoras. Which one is attributed to Pythagoras?\\

a$)$ The angles at the base of an isoceles triangle are congruent.\\
b$)$ A good approximation of the irrational number $\sqrt2$ \\
c$)$ The case of congruency of angle-side-angle triangles \\
d$)$ A line parallel to a side of a triangle drawn from one side to the other divides both sides in a proportionate fashion.\\

Answer: b$)$\\

Explanation: \\
The results \og The angles at the base of an isoceles triangle are congruent\fg , \og the case of congruency of angle-side-angle triangles\fg\ and  \og a parallel line drawn to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in a proportionate fashion\fg\ are all attributed to Thales of Miletos. On another note, it is important to recognize that even if the result \og one parallel line drawn through one side of a triangle divides the other two sides in a proportionate manner\fg\ is attributed to Thales of Miletos, we ignore who truly discovered this result. Pythagoras is credited with the first good approximation of $\sqrt2$. The correct answer is b$)$.

a$)$ Alan Baker \\
b$)$ George Darwin \\
c$)$ Nicolas Bourbaki  \\
d$)$ Nicholas Copernicus \\

Answer: d$)$\\

Explanation: \\
Nicholas Copernicus was the first to observe the circular movement of the planets. However, he didn't publish his works until a few days before he died because he feared receiving negative reactions from other theologists from that time period. His fears became legitimate as in 1616, Pope Paul V condemned the advanced ideas of Copernicus as being contrary to the "Writings". Thus, the correct answer is d$)$.\\

961- One day, Jerome Cardan found out that Tartaglia had discovered the solution to the cubic equation. He then began to continuously praise Tartaglia and eventually convinced him to reveal his method while promising under oath never to publish his work before Tartaglia had a chance to do it. Why did Cardan end up publishing Tartaglia's results?\\

a$)$ Because del Ferro had also discovered the method. \\
b$)$ Because Tartaglia had died.  \\
c$)$ Because Tartaglia had finally given him permission to do so.  \\
d$)$ Because he had gotten into an argument with Tartaglia. \\

Answer: a$)$\\
