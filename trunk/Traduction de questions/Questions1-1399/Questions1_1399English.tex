181-- Bianca Castafiore's bird flew and went over to perch on a wooden post in the middle of the neighbor's pond. Castafiore cannot go and retreive her bird without knowing the depth of the pond. However, the neighbor told her that at the time that he planted the post in the bottom of the pond, half of the post was driven into the mud. Furthermore, he told her that a third of the post was under water, between the muddy bottom and the surface. Lastly, we know that the post sticks out 50 cm from the water's surface. What is the depth of the pond?\\

a) 50 cm\\
b) 100 cm\\
c) 150 cm\\
d) 200 cm\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation: \\
We know that half of the post is in the mud, a third is under water and that the post sticks out 50 cm above the water's surface.\\[2mm]
$p$ represents the length of the post in cm.\\[2mm]
We know that $\frac{1}{2}p+\frac{1}{3}p+50$\,cm$\,=p$\\[2mm]
$\frac{3}{6}p+\frac{2}{6}p+50$\,cm$\,=p$\\[2mm]
$\frac{5}{6}p+50$\,cm$\,=p$\\[2mm]
50\,cm\,=\,$\frac{1}{6}p$\\[2mm]
300\,cm\,=\,$p$\\[2mm]
The post is 300 cm long. A third of the length is equal to the water's depth.\\
Thus, $\frac{1}{3}$ of 300\,cm is $\frac{1}{3}\times300$\,cm $=100$\,cm.\\
The pond is 100\,cm deep. Thus, the correct answer is b).\\

c) $\frac{1}{a}\times a=1$\\[2mm]
d) $\frac{1}{a}\times a = a$\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation: \\
When fractions are multiplied, the numerators are multiplied together and the denominators are multiplied together.  \\
$\frac{1}{a}\times a = \frac{1}{a} \times \frac {a}{1} = \frac{1\times
a}{a\times 1}=\frac{a}{a}=1$\\
Thus, the correct answer is c).\\

The correct answer is b).\\


231-- Cleopatra's father is three years younger than Cleopatra's age quadrupled. In addition, the sum of their ages is 52. How old is Cleopatra's father?\\

Answer: 41\\

Explanation: \\
\
Let's say that\\
$C$ = Cleopatra's age;\\
$P$ = her father's age.\\

Now we have the two following equations:\\
$P = 4C -3\qquad$ (equation 1)\\
$P + C = 52 \qquad$ (equation 2)\\

By manipulating equation 2, we get\\
$P = 52 - C\qquad$  (equation 3).\\
Then we replace $P$ from equation 1 with its valued obtained in equation 3.
And now we get\\
$52\,-\,C\,=\,4C\,-\,3$.\\
$55\,=\,5C$\\
By dividing each equal part by 5, we reach\\
$11\,=\,C$.\\

Thus, $P=52-C=52-11=41$.\\
The correct answer is 41 years old.\\

a) Two images\\
b) Two points\\
c) Two points and their image\\
d) The center and an image point\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation: \\
To define a homothetic transformation, one needs two points and their image because this allows us to find the center of the homothecy. To do this, one only needs to draw a straight line through a point and its image for each of the two pairs of points. The intersection of the two straight lines becomes the center of the homothecy. With the center, it is now possible to identify the homothetic relation. The correct answer is c).\\



271-- Which of the following four statements is true?\\

a) When a homothetic relation is positive, the final figure is greater than the initial figure.\\
