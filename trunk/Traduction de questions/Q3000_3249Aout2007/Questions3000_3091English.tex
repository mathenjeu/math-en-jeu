\ Calculate the following sum by referring to the table:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{1569.eps}\\
\end{center}

Answer: $1569$\\

Explanation :\\
The Lotus flower is worth $1000$, the Papyrus roll $100$, the basket handle $10$ and the stick $1$.\\
Therefore, the first group of symbols:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{1224.eps}\\
$= 1000 + 2 \times 100 + 2 \times 10 + 4 \times 1 = 1224$.\\[4mm]
\end{center}
And the second:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{345.eps}\\
$= 3 \times 100 + 4 \times 10 + 5 \times 1  = 345$.\\[4mm]
\end{center}
Thus, the answer is: $1224 + 345 = 1569$.\\

In order to form a number, a letter is written in descending order according to its value. For example, MI is written $1001$.  Each letter's value is added to form the number, unless
\begin{center}
I is to the left of V or X,\\
X is to the left of L or C,\\
C is to the left of D or M.\\
\end{center}
In this case, the{\small(598-668)} letter to the left is subtracted (for example: XL = L -- X = $50 - 10 = 40$).\\

Therefore, MMCDLXIV = $1000 + 1000 + (500 - 100) + 50 + 10 + (5 - 1) = 2464$. The correct answer is a).\\

3003-- The numbers `` $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ '' \ are of Arabic origin. Why did the Arabs decide to use the decimal system (based on 10) in mathematics?\\

a) Each Arab owned 10 sheep.\\
b) 10 was a sacred religious number\\
c) Humans have 10 fingers each.\\
d) In the old days, the Royal Family always had 10 children.\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
All research leads experts to believe that the decimal system comes from the possibility to count with our 10 fingers. The English synonym for finger, "digit", comes from the latin word "digitus", which means "finger". The correct answer is therefore c).\\



3004-- When was the first time that arithmetic symbols were used in mathematics? (for example: $+, -, \times , \leq , \geq $)\\

a) during the prehistoric era\\
b) $1000$ BC, during the Babylonian era\\
c) during the XIV century, at the beginning of the Renaissance era\\
d) during the XX century\\

Answer : c)\\

Explanation :\\
Before and throughout the Ancient Greek era, there weren't any symbols to represent arithmetic operations and relationships. People wrote out all their problems and solutions into words. It wasn't until the beginning of the Renaissance period that one could see the first symbols written out by hand. Thus, the correct answer is c).\\



3005-- How many different symbols exist to represent multiplication?\\

a) 1\\
b) 2\\
c) 3\\
d) 4\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation :\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\bf Evolution of the multiplication symbol}\\[2mm] \hline
{\bf Date of appearance} & {\bf Symbol} & {\bf Example} \\[1mm] \hline \hline

Thus, there are four ways to write the division symbol. The correct answer is d).\\



3007-- What important mathematic discovery do we use now on a daily basis that in the olden days was difficult to understand?\\

a) Counting on our fingers\\
b) Addition\\
c) Geometry\\
d) the number zero\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
Even if all of these discoveries were important, one of them was by far the most difficult to understand.\\
In the IX century, Indians defined an important mathematical concept: the `` \emph{zero} ''. Like most of the time, numbers were only used to count objects, it was difficult to associate the concept "there is no object" (there is nothing to count) to a number.  They must have seen the numbers $1, 2, 3, ...$ as objects and not only as numeric adjectives. Soon thereafter, these numbers had to exist even if there was nothing to count. And only then did  the number zero come into existence. The correct answer is d). It was the mathematician Al-Khwarizmi who spread his idea of the number zero to Western Europe.\\

3008-- In the XVII Century, a solution was proposed to resolve a second degree equation in the following manner: `` \emph{Move all the terms to the same congruent side in such a way that they equal zero.} ''
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{2} + 2 &=& 3x\\
x^{2} - 3x +2 &=& 0
\end{eqnarray*}\\
`` \emph{Factor equation and place each factor equal to zero.} ''
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{2} - x - 2x +2 = 0\\
x\cdot(x - 1) - 2\cdot(x - 1) = 0\\
(x - 1)\cdot(x - 2) = 0\\
(x - 1) = 0 \ \ \textrm{et} \ \ (x - 2) = 0\\
x = 1 \ \ \textrm{et} \ \ x = 2
\end{eqnarray*}\\
Which English mathematician came up with this idea?\\

a) Andrei Markov\\
b) John Pell\\
c) Thomas Harriot\\
d) Zenodore\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
Andrei Markov is the name of a Russian mathematician and a Russian hockey player. John Pell is an English mathematician who is known for the Pell's Equation. It was Thomas Harriot who came up with the idea of how to solve second degree equations. This principle is sometimes called "The Harriot Principle". Thus, the correct answer is c).\\

3009-- Which one of the following fractions is "well-written" according to Egyptians?\\

a) $\frac{1}{100}$\\[2mm]
b) $\frac{2}{5}$\\[2mm]
c) $\frac{5}{6}$\\[2mm]
d) $\frac{9}{10}$\\[2mm]

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
A "well-written" fraction (more commonly called an "Egyptian fraction") is a fraction whose numerator is equal to 1. Thus, the correct answer is a).\\



3010-- Who were the first people to set up a measuring system based on 60 (for example, $360^{\circ}$ in a circle, $60$ seconds in a minute, $60$ minutes in an hour) ?\\

a) The Arabs\\
b) The Greeks\\
c) Prehistoric men\\
d) The 60's group\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
The Arabs worked with a system of measurement based on 10 (Arabic numerals are numerals that we still use today: "$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$"). Babylonians already were working with a system of measurement based on 60, but it were the Greeks who established the system of measurement that we know today (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour). Thus, the correct answer is b).\\



3011-- In the 17th century Russian manuscripts, one can find the following drawing:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{carre_proportions.eps}
\end{center}
Which fraction corresponds with the shaded section?\\

a) $\frac{1}{96}$\\[2mm]
b) $\frac{1}{64}$\\[2mm]
c) $\frac{1}{16}$\\[2mm]
d) $\frac{1}{8}$\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
In Russian manuscripts, the shaded section is described as "half of the half of the half of the half of the half of the third." In other words,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{96}
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, the answer is a).\\



3012-- Who used to use fractions like we do now in modern times?\\

a) Babylonians\\
b) Chinese\\
c) The men from Cro-Magnon\\
d) Martians\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
In 100 B.C., the Chinese used fractions like we do for similar purposes: they avoided "improper" fractions, in other words, fractions formed by $\frac{7}{3}$. Instead, they wrote $2 \frac{1}{3}$. The correct answer is b).\\



3013-- The Chinese used the denominator method, commonly used to divide two fractions, for example, $\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{4}{5}$. The method states that in each fraction, the numerator and the denominator must be multiplied to the denominator of the other fraction:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{2}{3} \ \div \ \frac{4}{5} \ = \ \frac{2\cdot5}{3\cdot5} \ \div \ \frac{3\cdot4}{3\cdot5} \ = \ \frac{10}{15} \ \div \ \frac{12}{15}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Since the two fractions are now above the same denominator, the problem can be resolved thru the simple division of whole numbers:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{2}{3} \ \div \ \frac{4}{5} \ = \ \frac{10}{15} \ \div \ \frac{12}{15} \ = \ 10 \ \div \ 12 \ = \ \frac{5}{6}.
\end{eqnarray*}
By using this method, calculate $\frac{3}{4} \ \div \ \frac{9}{11}$.\\

Answer: $\frac{11}{12}$\\

Explanation:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{3}{4} \ \div \ \frac{9}{11} \ &=& \ \frac{3\cdot11}{4\cdot11} \ \div \ \frac{4\cdot9}{4\cdot11}\\[2mm]
&=& \ \frac{33}{44} \ \div \ \frac{36}{44}\\[2mm]
&=& \ 33 \ \div \ 36\\[2mm]
&=& \ \frac{11}{12}
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, the correct answer is $\frac{11}{12}$.\\



3014-- The reverse multiplication method requires inversing the divisor and multiplying it to the dividend. For example,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{2}{3} \ \div \ \frac{4}{5} \ = \ \frac{2}{3} \ \times \ \frac{5}{4} \ = \ \frac{10}{12} \ = \ \frac{5}{6}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Around 850 A.D., who was the first to practice this method?\\

a) Apollonius\\
b) Rene Descartes\\
c) Mahavira\\
d) Multit Plie Kassion\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
The reverse multipication method can only be used if in a fraction, one number is written above the other. Indian mathematicians were the first to write fractions in this way. More specifically, it was the Indian mathematician Mahavira who practiced the reverse multiplication method around 850 A.D. Thus, the correct answer is c).\\



3015-- The term "percent" or "percentage" is the name given to fractions whose denominator is 100. It was during the 15th and 16th centuries that this term was first used in a context other than that of pure mathematics. Which one?\\

a) Trade\\
b) Tax collecting\\
c) Medecine\\
d) Urbanization\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
It was common in those days to calculate commercial interest rates by using percentage. This particular custom has remained in the business field even today. It is also one of the reasons why our monetary system is based on the dollar and the "cent". Thus, the correct answer is a).\\



3016-- Which one of these symbols has never been used to represent a percentage?\\

a) per 100\\[2mm]
b) $\frac{0}{0}$\\[2mm]
c) \%\\[2mm]
d) $\scriptstyle0/100$\\[2mm]

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

a few years later & `` $\frac{0}{0}$ '' \\[1mm] \hline
today & `` \% '' \\[1mm] \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The symbol that has never existed is `` $\scriptstyle0/100$ ''. The correct answer is d).\\



3017-- In which century did number writing in decimal notation (for example 0.25) become popular?\\

a) 3rd century\\
b) 16th century\\
c) 17th century\\
d) 21st century\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
It was in 1585, in a book by Belgian mathematician, Simon Stevin, that fraction writing in decimal numbers was shown to be the most simple form of writing. For Stevin, the decimal number $0.333$ is a good estimation of the fraction $\frac{1}{3}$. Today we know that $\frac{1}{3} = 0,\overline3$, in other words, that there is an infinite quantity of 3 after the decimal point. Thus, the correct answer is b).\\

a) 500 B.C.\\
b) 1300\\
c) 1729\\
d) 1919\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
The first arithmetic book using a comma to separate the integral part from the fractional part of a number was printed in North America in 1729. Soon thereafter, some books began using a decimal point in place of a comma. Today, the comma is used in French and the decimal point in English. Thus, the correct answer is c).\\



3019-- What Flemish (Belgian) mathematician was the first to consider real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) to be points on a straight line?\\

a) Gerardus Mercator\\
b) Nicolaus Copernicus\\
c) Gesuit Bellje\\

3020-- Negative numbers have existed since 1500 B.C.?\\
True or False?\\

Answer: False\\

Explanation:\\
At the time that Christopher Columbus discovered America, negative numbers didn't exist.  It wasn't until 200 years later that they were accepted into the number family. Thus, the correct answer is: False.\\
In the beginning, numbers were used mainly to count objects. When the number 0 became widely accepted, it was considered to be the smallest of all numbers. After all, what could be smaller than nothing at all?\\ (Still, mathematicians knew that such numbers existed, but in their problems, like for example, find the solution of $4x + 20 = 4$, they simply rejected any negative answer (there were no solutions to these equations in those days, even if $x = -4$ was a solution)).\\



3021-- Who was the first Indian mathematician to work with negative "quantities"? (not numbers, but quantities)\\

a) Brahmagupta\\
b) Tuhaf Detz\\
c) Carl Friedrich Gauss\\
d) Pythagoras\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
Brahmagupta {\small(598-668)}, an Indian mathematician worked with assets (positive quantities) and debts (negative quantities). He even created rules to add, subtract, multiply and divide these assets and debts. Thus, the correct answer is a).\\

3022-- {If $-1$ is smaller but not equal to 1, then $\frac{-1}{1} = \frac{1}{-1}$ cannot be valid, for the smallest number over the largest cannot be equal to the largest number over the smallest. For example: $1 < 3 \ \textrm{et} \ \frac{1}{3} \neq \frac{3}{1}$.}\\[2mm]
Who was the 17th century mathematician to first raise this question?\\

a) Antoine Arnauld\\
b) Euclid\\
c) Omar Khayyam\\
d) Sim\'eon Denis Poisson\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
Even after the acceptance of negative numbers in the number family, 17th century mathematicians had trouble putting them in the right order. How could $-1$ be smaller than 1, while their ratios $\frac{-1}{1}$ et $\frac{1}{-1}$ are equal? Antoine Arnauld {\small (1612-1694)} was the first to raise this question. Thus, the correct answer is a).

a) Georges Cantor\\
b) Henri Navier\\
c) John Wallis\\
d) Joseph Fourier\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
In the book `` \emph{Arithmetica Infinitorum} '' \ by John Wallis, he states that `` \emph{numbers inferior to 0 are larger than infinity} ''. \ The correct answer is c), John Wallis.

Explaining his reasoning: \emph{Since \ $\frac{3}{0} = \infty$, a denominator smaller than $0$ chosen in another fraction, makes the new fraction larger than $\frac{3}{0}$ (for example, since $1 < 2$, then $3 = \frac{3}{1} > \frac{3}{2} = 1,5$). In this way, since $-1 < 0$, then $\frac{3}{-1} > \frac{3}{0} = \infty$. We know now that even if $-1 < 0$, $-3 = \frac{3}{-1} < \frac{3}{0} = \infty$.}\\



3024-- Which well-known English physicist and mathematician said the following: `` \emph{Quantities are positive and larger than nothing or negative and smaller than nothing.}''?\\

a) Georges Adams\\
b) Isaac Newton\\
c) Johnny Test\\
d) Michel Rolle\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
Contrary to common belief, Isaac Newton did not only work in the physics field. In 1707, in a book that he wrote `` \emph{Universal Arithmetick} '', he illustrated that positive quantities are larger than zero and negative quantities are smaller than zero. Since Newton was a great scientist in his era, his idea was taken very seriously. Thus, the correct answer is b).\\

The French Academy of Science defined meters as 1/10,000,000 the length of the Earth's arc between the North Pole and the \emph{\underline{Equator}}, and not the South Pole. The answer is: False. The Earth's circonference measures approximately $40\,000$ kilometers long. The quarter of this circonference, which is in fact the arc between the North Pole and the Equator, is about $10,000$ kilometers long. 1/10,000,000 of $10\,000$ kilometers is equal to 0.001 kilometer, or one meter.
\begin{eqnarray*}
10\,000\,\text{km} \div 10\,000 000 &=& 0,001\,\text{km}\\
&=& 0,001\,\text{km} \times \frac{1\,000\,\text{m}}{1\,\text{km}}\\
&=& 1\,\text{m}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

3029-- Units of measure smaller than a meter have a Latin prefix and units of measure larger than a meter have a Greek prefix.\\
True or False?\\

Answer: True\\

Explanation:\\
The fact that units of measure smaller or larger than a meter be in powers of 10, makes the metric system easier to understand.\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|} \hline
{\it Nom} & {\it Symbol} & {\it Quantity in digits}  \\ \hline \hline
\textbf{giga}meter & Gm & $1 \, 000 \, 000 \, 000$\\ \hline
\textbf{mega}meter & Mm & $1 \, 000 \, 000$\\ \hline
\textbf{kilo}meter & km & $1 \, 000$\\ \hline
\textbf{hecto}meter & hm & $100$\\ \hline
\textbf{deca}meter & dam & $10$\\ \hline
meter & m & $1$\\ \hline
\textbf{deci}meter & dm & $0,1$\\ \hline
\textbf{centi}meter & cm & $0,01$\\ \hline
\textbf{milli}meter & mm & $0,001$\\ \hline
\textbf{micro}meter & $\mu$m & $0,000 \, 001$\\ \hline
\textbf{nano}meter & nm & $0,000 \, 000 \, 001$\\ \hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The prefixes for units smaller than a meter (deci-, centi-, milli-, \dots) are Latin. The prefixes for units larger than a meter (deca-, hecto-, kilo-, \dots) are Greek. The correct answer is: True.\\

3031-- Which angle measurement was invented in order to calculate the length of the Earth's arc?\\

a) degree\\
b) grade\\
c) rad\\
d) minute\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
In attempting to calculate the length of the Earth's arc, researchers hired by the French Academy of Science decided to invent an angle measurement that would use powers of 10, in the same manner as the metric system. They then established the measurement for a right angle equal to 100 grades (90$^\circ$ = 100 gr). The correct answer is b).\\



3032-- To which German mathematician do we owe the definition of a function in terms of set pairs, in other words $y = f(x)$?\\

a) Bjornen Atinephortifhive\\
b) Georg Cantor\\
c) Pythagoras\\
d) William Brouncker\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
Georg Cantor's work is at the origin of the Set Theory. He defined a function as being a set of pairs. As Cantor explains, a function can be drawn in Cartesian, in other words, according to $x$ and $y$. For example, $y = f(x) = x^{3} + x^{2} + x$.
%Cela a permis \`a Cantor de d\'efinir la fonction bijective ou bijection (si on prend un \'el\'ement $y$ dans l'ensemble d'arriv\'ee (image ou codomaine), alors il existe un et un seul \'el\'ement $x$ dans l'ensemble de d\'epart (domaine) qui est une solution de la fonction $y = f(x)$.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fonction.eps}\\
$f(x) = x^{3} + x^{2} + x$\\
\end{center}
Thus, the answer is d).

3034-- Christoff Rudolff composed a treaty, `` \emph{Das Coss} '', for `` \emph{the thing} '' \ in the meaning of the unknown of an algebraic equation. In 1525, what symbol did this German mathematician invent?\\

a) Empty set:\ \ $\varnothing$\\
b) Infinity:\ \ $\infty$\\
c) Natural set:\ \ $\mathbb{N}$\\
d) Square root:\ \ $\surd$\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
The resolution of quadratic equations brings into play the notion of square roots. At that time, people needed some sort of notation to express this mathematic operation. Christoff Rudolff studied the resolution of algebraic equations. He used and invented notations as concise as possible, for instance the square root sign($\surd$). Thus, the correct answer is d). These days, the same sign is used the only difference being the bar above ($\sqrt{ \ \ }$).\\

3040-- According to the legend, in Ancient Greece Thales of Miletos was put to the challenge by Pharaoh Amasis. Name this challenge.\\

a) Calculating the amount of gold coins that could fit in his sarcophagus (type of stone coffin).\\
b) Designing a water reservoir large enough to supply the entire city for one month's time.\\
c) Determining which one was the heaviest construction between the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza.\\
d) Measuring the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza.\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
Pharaoh Amasis would say that no one was able to measure the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Thus, the correct answer is d). To obtain the correct calculation, Thales based his argument on the fact that at a certain hour in the day, every object's shadow becomes equal to the height of the same object (Sun rays are thus inclined to 45$^\circ$).  He chose a moment on a specific day and he used his own size to measure the shadow of the Great Pyramid to which he had added half of the length of the pyramid's base. He calculated 85 thales which is equal to 276.25 Egyptian Royal Cubits. In reality, the pyramid is approximately 280 Royal Egyptian Cubits (137 meters) high which is an excellent estimate for that time period.\\

a) `` \emph{Art of The Thing} ''\\
b) `` \emph{Cossic Art} ''\\
c) `` \emph{Equations Art} ''\\
d) `` \emph{The Thing and its Art} ''\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
Algebraic equation writing was done in words and not in symbols; it was very complex and considered to be an art. The English were inspired by the word `` \emph{coss} '', thing, that for German mathematicians implied the designation of a variable. Thus, `` \emph{coss} '', `` \emph{cossic} '', hence its name: `` \emph{Cossic Art} ''. The correct answer is b).\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
`` \emph{Summa Aritmetica} '' was published in 1494. The answer is a). This book would serve as a main introductive source to the symbolic art of algebraic equations.\\



3054-- The main problem with Luca Pacioli's notation is that in an algebraic equation, one can only express one unknown at once. This type of equation would look something like this:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
cu.\tilde{m}.5.ce.\tilde{p}.7.co.\textrm{------}\mathcal{R}v.co.\tilde{p}.6.
\end{eqnarray*}
True or False?\\

Answer: True\\

Explanation:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
cu.\tilde{m}.5.ce.\tilde{p}.7.co.\textrm{------}\mathcal{R}v.co.\tilde{p}.6.
\end{eqnarray*}
The abbreviation `` $co$ '' \ represents `` \emph{cosa} '', thing, or the unknown quantity. `` $ce$ '' and `` $cu$ '' are respectively `` \emph{censo} ''  and `` \emph{cubo} '', from the Italian square and cube. `` $v$ '' means `` \emph{universal} ''. It regroups all of the terms that follow it. For example, `` \emph{co} '' refers to a single unknown quantity. The weakness of this notation is in the impossibility of representing more than one unknown at a time. The correct answer is: True. In current notation, the expression would be written:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
cu.\tilde{m}.4.ce.\tilde{p}.10.co.\textrm{------}\mathcal{R}v.co.\tilde{p}.3. \ \ \Longleftrightarrow \ \ x^{3} - 4x^{2} + 10x = \sqrt{x + 3}
\end{eqnarray*}\\

c) Joseph Liouville\\
d) Nicolas Chuquet\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
Nicolas Chuquet wrote `` \emph{Triparty en la science des nombres} '', a book about algebra in which he created different notations in order to clarify the art of working with algebraic expressions. He invented such terms as:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
5^{2} \ \ \ \ \ \text{which is now written:} \ \ \ \ \ 5x^{2}.\\
\mathcal{R}^{3} 5 \ \ \ \ \ \text{which is now written:} \ \ \ \ \ \sqrt[3]{5}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The correct answer is d).\\



3056-- Nicolas Chuquet never published `` \emph{Triparty en la science des nombres} '' in his lifetime. One of his students published `` \emph{L'arismetique} '' which in fact is a copy of Chuquet's book. Who is this copying French mathematician?\\

a) Atomic Betty\\
b) Estienne de La Roche\\
c) Pythagoras\\
d) Ren\'e Descartes\\

This first notation uses points to separate a large number into sets of six digits. Today, in English notation, dots are still used to separate large numbers but in sets of three digits, not six. In French notation, however, spaces are used to separate large numbers in sets of three digits.\\

a) Blaise Pascal\\
b) Joseph Liouville\\
c) Nicolas Chuquet\\
d) Pafnouti Tchebychev\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
Nicolas Chuquet had the idea of regrouping large numbers in sets of six and separating them with dots. The correct answer is c). At the beginning of the 17th century, large numbers were divided into groups of three instead of six to enhance readability. Still today, in the English number system, dots are used to separate numbers in groups of three (however, in the French number system, spaces are now used instead of dots). Today, the names given by Chuquet are known as the "long scale" in the English language. \\

a) Bartholomew J. Simpson\\
b) Galileo Galilei\\
c) Pierre Fatou\\
d) Ren\'e Descartes\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
In addition to inventing the following notation: $5x^{3} - 8y^{2}$, otherwise known as exponents used to express powers, Ren\'e Descartes invented the usage of letters from the alphabet: constants, by the first letters of the alphabet ($a, b, c, \dots$)  and variables, by the last letters of the alphabet  ($x, y, z$). The correct answer is d).\\

a) Bonaventura Cavalieri\\
b) Danny Ocean\\
c) Robert Recorde\\
d) Sofia Kovalevska\"ia\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
In 1557, Robert Recorde proposed the usage of  ``$=$'' to designate equality. The correct answer is c). This symbol was used widely throughout England but wasn't very popular in continental Europe. Most likely it was Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz that contributed the most to the adoption of the symbol ``$=$''.\\

a) \includegraphics[scale=0.09]{egaliteDescartes.eps}\\
b) $\sim$\\
c) ------\\
d) $\asymp$\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
Ren\'e Descartes has invented the symbol \includegraphics[scale=0.09]{egaliteDescartes.eps} to represent equality. Pacioli used the symbol ------. In 18th century literature, one can sometimes come across the symbol $\sim$ (nowadays, $\sim$ designates an approximation). But $\asymp$ was never used to designate equality. The correct answer is d).\\



3063-- Even in Ancient Egypt, scribes already knew how to solve first degree equations. For example:
\begin{center}
`` \emph{A third of a quantity plus itself equals 16.} ''\\
\end{center}
In actual notation, it would be written as: $x + \frac{x}{3} = 16$.\\[2mm]
Scribes proceeded in the following manner:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item They chose a quantity; in this instance it would be 3, for a third of 3 is easy to calculate! \ ($3\times \frac{1}{3} = 1$)
\item 3 plus a third of 3 equals $3 + \frac{3}{3} = 3 + 1 = 4$.
\item 16 is the targeted number but we only are up to 4. So, 4 must be multiplied by 4. ($4 \times 4 = 16$).
\item Since $x = 3$, then $4 \times 3 = 12$.\\
The answer is 12.
\end{itemize}
Let's double check: if $x = 12$, then $x + \frac{x}{3} = 12 + \frac{12}{3} = 12 + 4 = 16$.\\
\\
What is the name of this method?\\

a) Complementary division method\\
b) False position method\\
c) Complete multiplication method\\
d) Substitution method\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
This method is called the ``False position method''. It was given this name because the $x$ in the equation does not represent the correct answer, but instead, it is chosen mainly because it is easy to work with. The correct answer is b). Let's bring the equation back to $Ax = B$. It would seem easy to solve this equation, but one must remember that in that time period, fractional calculations and symbolism weren't exactly mastered arts and negative numbers weren't even invented yet.\\



3064-- The double false position method allows us to calculate a first degree equation through the following formula: $Ax + C = B$. Which ethnic group invented this method?\\

a) The Arabs\\
b) The Babylonians\\
c) The Chinese\\
d) The Egyptians\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
The Chinese developed the double false position method in order to solve first degree equations through the following formula: $Ax + C = B$. The correct answer is c). Note that the Indians also used this method.\\



3065-- In order to solve a quadratic equations ($ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$), mathematician Al-Khwarizmi used the following formula:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x = \sqrt{\Big(\frac{b}{2}\Big)^{2} + c} \ - \frac{b}{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
In fact, Al-Khwarizmi studied the form of the equation  $x^{2} + bx = c$, in which the constants $b$ and $c$ are positive. Note that this notation did not exist at that time period and that the notation, instead, would have been written in words.\\

The biggest difference between this formula and the one known today
\begin{eqnarray*}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{eqnarray*}
is only in the way it is written.\\
True or False?\\

Answer: False\\

Explanation:\\
In that era, people only accepted positive roots and rejected all negative roots because they did not know about negative numbers yet. Nowadays, these two types of roots are both accepted, hence the arrival of the  $\pm$ sign. Thus, the biggest difference between these two formulas isn't in the way that they are written but rather in the fact that they are both considered as two distinct roots. The correct answer is: False.\\

Pythagoras founded the Pythagorean School around 500 B.C. The students were called Pythagoreans and they philosophized about mathematics. Since geometry was ever-present back then, it was natural for Pythagoreans to associate numbers to geometric figures. The correct answer is c).\\



3067-- Which mathematicians proposed the following solution:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{eqnarray*}
to the quadratic equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$?\\

a) Archimedes of Syracuse and Pythagoras\\
b) Asterix and Obelix\\
c) Andre\"i Markov and Pafnouti Tchebychev\\
d) Thomas Harriot and Ren\'e Descartes\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
Thomas Harriot and Ren\'e Descartes realized that it would be easier to write equations as ``things'' equal to zero. The main advantage to this is that the equations $ax^{2} + bx = c$ and $ax^{2} + c = bx$ can be seen as exceptions to the general equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$. So, Harriot and Descartes presented the general solution as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{eqnarray*}
The correct answer is d).

a) Ancient Egypt\\
b) Ancient Greece\\
c) The Middle Ages\\
d) The Renaissance period\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
One must go back all the way to 400 B.C. to find the first solution to a cubic equation problem; this geometric problem is of Greek origins. The correct answer is b).\\



3069-- Which problem is at the origin of cubic (to the third degree) equation solutions research?\\

a) the volume calculation problem\\
b) the cube duplication problem (doubling a cube's volume)\\
c) the human sharing problem \\
d) the angle trisection problem (divide one angle into three equal angles)\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
The cubic equation solving process began with the angle trisection problem. The correct answer is d). The problem is read as follows:\\
\begin{quote}
\emph{With any given angle $\angle ABC$, there is a way to divide an angle into three equal angles with the help of an unmarked ruler and a compass.}\\
\end{quote}
The answer is \underline{No}; it is impossible to trisect an angle with only an unmarked ruler and a compass.\\
Note that in certain cases trisection would be possible, if the ruler were marked.\\



3070-- According to Omar Khayyam (1048-1131), how many different forms of cubic equations are there if the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is 1, the equation is not null, and the coefficients are positive? (For example, $x^{3} + bx = c, x^{3} = ax^{2} + c$ are a few forms of third degree equations.)

\href{http://www.nndb.com/people/043/000031947/}{www.nndb.com/people/043/000031947/}\\
\end{center}

a) 6\\
b) 10\\
c) 14\\
d) 19\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
In third degree equations, Arabs didn't consider negative numbers to be numbers and they accepted zero as a coefficient, but without allowing an equation to ever be equal to zero. Thus, $x^{3} + bx = c$ and $x^{3} = bx + c$ are two different equations. There are 14 in all. The correct answer is c).
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}\hline
$x^{3} = ax^{2} + bx + c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + bx + c = ax^{2}$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + c = ax^{2} + bx$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + c = bx$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + c = ax^{2}$ \ \ \ \\ \hline
$x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx = c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + ax^{2} = bx + c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} = bx + c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} = ax^{2} + c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} = c$\ \ \ \\ \hline
$x^{3} + ax^{2} + c = bx$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + bx = ax^{2} + c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + bx = c$ \ \ \ & $x^{3} + ax^{2} = c$ \ \ \ & \multicolumn{1}{l}{} \ \ \ \\ \cline{1-4}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Note that every equation that doesn't contain the constant $c$ is not evaluated because they can't be cubic equations without $c$. For example: $x^{3} = ax^{2} + bx$ can be simplified into a quadratic equation by dividing each term by $x$ : $x^{2} = ax + b$.\\



3071-- Omar Khayyam discovered a geometric solution for half of the cubic equations (for example, for $x^{3} = c$, $x^{3} + ax^{2} = c$, \dots).\\
True or False?\\

Answer: False\\

Explanation:\\
Omar Khayyam discovered a geometric solution for all 14 cubic equations; not just for only half of them. The correct answer is: false. The majority of solutions involve conical sections (parabolas, hyperbolas, \dots) and many have annotations to insure that there aren't any positive answers, for negative numbers didn't exist yet.

3073-- Scipione del Ferro (1465-1526) and Niccolo Fontana (1500-1557) (better known as ``\emph{Tartaglia}'') both discovered solutions to certain cubic equations. Why did they keep these solutions secret?\\

a) Because they were afraid of not having the right answer.\\
b) Because each one was afraid that the other would steal their solutions and publish them first.\\
c) In order to write the largest possible amount of solutions on their tombstone.\\
d) In order to challenge each other.\\

Answer: d)\\

%{\bf \textsf{animation: 2 petits bonhommes se lancent des chiffres ou \dots}}\\
Explanation:\\
It was common in those days for mathematicians to challenge each other. The correct answer is d). One challenge took place as follows: each mathematician prepared a page of questions for the other and he who finished first or had the most correct answers won the challenge. In most cases, a university professor position was at stake.\\



3074-- On his deathbed, Scipione del Ferro revealed secrets (solutions for certain cubic equations) to one of his students. In 1535, Tartaglia claimed that he could solve these cubic equations, but wouldn't reveal the answers to anyone. The student in question put Tartaglia up to a challenge. Unfortunately, he lost against Tartaglia. Who was this Italian student of del Ferro's?\\

a) Antonio Maria Fiore\\
b) Brahmagupta\\
c) John Pell\\
d) Paolo Rufini\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
Scipione del Ferro revealed to Antonio Maria Fiore his solution to the equation $x^{3} + bx = c$. The correct answer is a). It turned out that Tartaglia knew how to solve equations in $x^{3} + ax^{2} = c$ form. The day of the duel, Fiore had only prepared questions on cubic equations for Tartaglia. According to Tartaglia, he had prepared mathematical questions of all sorts for Fiore. He answered all of Fiore's questions, while Fiore had all the trouble in the world answering even one of Tartaglia's questions. Tartaglia one this duel handily.\\

3076-- Girolamo Cardano had heard that Tartaglia knew how to solve certain cubic equations. He begged Tartaglia to see these cubic equation solutions. After a while, Tartaglia finally agreed, but only in the condition that Cardano wouldn't reveal these solutions to anyone. With the solutions in hand, Cardano tackled the resolution problem of the general cubic equation  ($x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx =c$). How many years did it take him to find the complete answer?\\

a) 4 years\\
b) 5 years\\
c) 6 years\\
d) 100 years\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
It took Girolamo Cardano 6 years to find a complete answer to the general cubic equation. The correct answer is c).\\



3077-- Cardano's assistant, born in 1522 and deceased in 1565 in Italy, found a solution to the fourth degree general equation by using Cardano's solution for the general cubic equation ($x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx =c$). Who was this assistant?\\

a) Johannes Kepler\\
b) Leonardo of Pisa\\
c) Ludovico Ferrari\\
d) Piero della Franscesca\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
Girolamo Cardano's assistant was Ludovico Ferrari. The correct answer is c). His method consists of converting a fourth degree equation into a third degree equation. In order to get to the final answer, Ferrari used Cardano's method.\\



3078-- Historically, after having found solutions to third and fourth degree equations, the next step was to find complete solutions for fifth degree equations. Unfortunately, it turns out that such solutions don't exist.\\
True or False?\\

Answer: True\\

Explanation:\\
It wasn't until a few centuries later that it was proven that fifth degree equations do not have complete solutions. The correct answer is: True. In order to prove it, mathematicians had to change completely their way of looking at things. Thus, a new branch of mathematics was born: abstract algebra.\\



3079-- Tartaglia confided his solutions to a few cubic equations to Girolamo Cardano while making him promise not to reveal his secret to anyone. Cardano with the help of Tartaglia's solutions, found a solution to the general cubic equation ($x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx =c$). Then, he wanted to publish his findings, but how could he do it without breaking his promise? How did he find a way to do this?\\

a) He discovered that Scipione del Ferro had made the same discovery as Tartaglia, but a few years earlier.\\
b) He made Tartaglia believe that he had had his notes stolen and that he had published his findings under a fake name.\\
c) He had it published by his student, Ludovico Ferrari.\\
d) He had taken his own life so he could then publish his writings.\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
He found out that del Ferro had made the same discovery as Tartaglia, but only a few years before. The correct answer is a). As he hadn't promised anything to del Ferro, he decided to go ahead and publish. Tartaglia was furious.\\



3080-- After the release of Girolamo Cardano's book, `` \emph{Ars Magna} '', that revealed the secret about a few of Tartaglia's resolutions to certain cubic equations, Ludovico Ferrari, Cardano's assistant, put Tartaglia up to a mathematic challenge. Still furious with Cardano, Tartaglia said he would only accept the invitation if Cardano didn't participate. Cardano and Tartaglia would eventually end up duelling each other.\\
True or false?\\

Answer: False\\

Explanation:\\
Tartaglia didn't compete against Cardano. The correct answer is: False. However, one day, he was offered a university professor position. In order to be hired, he had to beat Ludovico Ferrari in a mathematic duel. Ferrari won the duel, and thus was awarded the position.\\



3081-- Girolamo Cardano stumbled across a major problem in his quest to find complete solutions to general cubic equations ($x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx = c$): certain solutions didn't seem to make much sense. For example:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{3} = 15x + 4,
\end{eqnarray*}

Using the Cardano method, one finds a solution using the following form:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x = \sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{-121}} + \sqrt[3]{2 - \sqrt{-121}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

With the acceptance of negative roots, one could say that this equation doesn't allow for a complete answer. However, the legitimate solution is $x = 4$
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{3} = 15x + 4 \ \Rightarrow \ 64 = 4^{3} = 15 \times 4 + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64.
\end{eqnarray*}

Which Italian mathematician found the solution to this problem?\\

a) Eugene De La Montagne\\
b) Girolamo Cardano\\
c) Raffaele Bombelli\\
d) Vicenzo Viviani\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
Raffaele Bombelli (1526-1572) found the solution to this problem. The correct answer is c). First, he showed geometrically that $x^{3} = px + q$ allows for a positive solution. Also, he demonstrated that for many different values of $p$ and $q$, solving this equation leads to a solution allowing for a root of negative numbers. He demonstrated that it's possible to work with roots of negative numbers and find a solution in the real domain.\\



3082-- Which Italian mathematician introduced two new numbers in order to find every solution to every cubic equation ($x{^3} + ax^{2} + bx = c$)?\\

a) Archimedes of Syracuse\\
b) Girolamo Cardano\\
c) Isaac Newton\\
d) Raffaele Bombelli\\

Answer: d)\\

Explanation:\\
Raffaele Bombelli introduced negative numbers and imaginary numbers in order to be able to find every solution to every cubic equation. The correct answer is d). Imaginary numbers are used to work with roots of negative numbers ($\sqrt{-2} = i\sqrt{2}$).\\



3083-- Niccolo Fontana was better known as `` \emph{Tartaglia} ''. Why?\\

a) Niccolo Fontana loved eating sweet tarts, hence the nickname `` \emph{Tartaglia} ''.\\
b) Niccolo Fontana had a stuttering problem. `` \emph{Tartagliare} '' \ means `` \emph{to stutter} '' \ in Italian.\\
c) Niccolo Fontana slept very little and it was during his periods of insomnia that he made his greatest mathematical discoveries. Since `` \emph{tartaglia} '' \ means ``\emph{insomnia} '' \ in Italian, that's what he was nicknamed.\\
d) Niccolo Fontana only ate tartar fish, hence the nickname `` \emph{Tartaglia}''.\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
Niccolo Fontana stuttered and since ``\emph{tartagliare} '' \ means `` \emph{to stutter} '' in Italian, that's how he got his nickname. The correct answer is b). He stuttered because he got hit in the face by a sword during the storming of Brescia by the French in 1512.\\



3084-- A ``\emph{pythagorean triple} '' \ is a triple of three positive integers that meet the requirements of the Pythagorean theorem ($a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$). For example, (3, 4, 5)\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{triplet345.eps}\\
\end{center}
\begin{eqnarray*}
3^{2} + 4^{2} = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Pythagoras discovered the first Pythagorean triples.\\
True or False?\\

Answer: False\\

Explanation:\\
A list of Pythagorean triples was found on a babylonian writing tablet dating back to 1000 years before Pythagoras. The correct answer is: False. This tablet is called `` \emph{Plimpton 322} ''.

3085-- Here is geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem:\\
A square on its side $(a+b)$, its area is:\\
\begin{center}
Area of square $ = (a+b)^{2} = a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}$.
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{carrcarre.eps}
\end{center}
On the inside of this square, there is another square on its side $c < a+b$ in the sense that its highest points are on the sides of the square on its side $(a+b)$. The largest square is then formed with four triangles on their sides $a$ and $b$ and with a square on its side $c$.
Thus, the area of the largest square can be written as:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{Area of square} &=& 4 \times  \textrm{area of triangle} + \textrm{area of square on its side} \ c\\
&=& 4 \times  \Big( \frac{a\times b}{2} \Big) + c^{2}\\
&=& 2ab + c^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus
\begin{eqnarray*}
a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} &=& 2ab + c^{2}\\
\Leftrightarrow a^{2} + b^{2} &=& c^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

When was this proved?\\

a) In Babylonian times ($\sim$ 1700 B.C.)\\
b) During the Chinese Era ($\sim$ 1000 B.C.)\\
c) In Ancient Egypt ($\sim$ 3200 B.C.)\\
d) In Ancient Greece ($\sim$ 500 B.C.)\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
This was proved in Ancient Chinese documents in 1000 B.C. The answer is b). In the famous Chinese manuscript ``{Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art} '', the ninth chapter is dedicated to problem solving using the Pythagorean Theorem.\\



3086-- Here is geometrical proof of the Pythagorean Theorem:\\
A square with side length $c$ has an area equal to $c^{2}$. Two right-angled triangles are trace in this square in such a way that their hypothenuse lie on the sides of the square. Thus, the following figures are found:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{carrec2.eps} & \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{pythagore2.eps}\\
{\small Figure 1} & {\small Figure 2} \\
 & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The triangles on Figure 2 are moved in order to form Figure 4. Since manipulations don't modify the area, the area of Figure 2 is equal to that of Figure 4.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{pythagore21.eps} & \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{a2b2.eps}\\
{\small Figure 3} & {\small Figure 4} \\
 & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The area of Figure 4 is $a^{2} + b^{2}$.\\

Since the area of Figure 2 and Figure 4 are the same, then $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$.\\

3087-- Which Greek mathematician gave a demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem by using the following figure:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pyth_euclide.eps}\\
\end{center}

a) Euclid\\
b) Fibonacci\\
c) Pythagoras\\
d) Tartaglia\\

Answer: a)\\

Answer:\\
Euclid used areas and not lengths in order to prove the Pythagorean theorem. He adopted the following figure:\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pyth_euclide2.eps}\\
\end{center}

The answer is a). Through properties of geometric statements, he showed that a square with side length $a$ has the same area as the small rectangle in the square of side length $c$ and that the square of side length $b$ has the same area as the large rectangle in the square of side length $c$.  A short time later, he was able to prove that the opposite was also true: if two areas match up, then the triangle in the figure is rectangular.\\



3088-- Which 18th Century French mathematician began his mathematical work by rewriting one of Apollonius of Perga's books?\\

a) Georges Boole\\
b) Marin Mersenne\\
c) Pierre de Fermat\\
d) Vladimir Drinfield\\

Answer: c)\\

Explanation:\\
Pierre de Fermat started his mathematical career by rewriting one of Apollonius de Perga's books.  The correct answer is c). Since Apollonius' findings were incomplete, Fermat worked on them until they were finished.\\



3089-- Which French mathematician never published his discoveries but rather corresponded with his mathematical colleagues (Descartes, Mersenne, Pascal \dots)?\\

a) Hylika Talkalota\\
b) Pierre de Fermat\\
c) Pythagoras\\
d) Tartaglia\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
Pierre de Fermat wrote letters to his fellow mathematicians asking them to prove the solutions that he came up with. The correct answer is b).  It wasn't until 1670, five years after his death, that one of his most famous theorems went public. This theorem goes by the name of `` \emph{Fermat's last theorem} '' \ and it is written as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{n} + y^{n} = z^{n} \ \ \textrm{does not allow complete answer for} \ n > 2.
\end{eqnarray*}



3090-- Pierre de Fermat discovered ``\emph{Fermat's last theorem} '' \ in approximately 1630.  However, his complete works weren't found until 1994. Who found these works?\\

a) Andrew Wiles\\
b) Beno\^it Mandelbrot\\
c) Georges Dantzig\\
d) Pierre de Fermat\\

Answer: a)\\

Explanation:\\
The only note that Pierre de Fermat had written down about ``Fermat's last theorem'' was an annotation in the margin where he had written his theorem.  This annotation said that the margin wouldn't be large enough to demonstrate his theorem.  In 1993, Andrew Wiles made the announcement that he had finally proved ``\emph{Fermat's last theorem} ''.  The correct answer is a).  Once his proof was written, he had it read over for approval and after a few months, they found a hole in his work. Finally, in September of 1994, he completed his proof. It had taken approximately 354 years to prove ``\emph{Fermat's last theorem} ''.\\



3091-- Legend has it that the 16th President of the United States of America kept a copy of `` \emph{Euclid's Elements} '' \ (Ancient Greek geometry book) with him that he studied at night by candle light. Who was this president?\\

a) George Washington\\
b) Abraham Lincoln\\
c) John F. Kennedy\\
d) Theodore Roosevelt\\

Answer: b)\\

Explanation:\\
George Washington was the first president, John F. Kennedy the 35th and Theodore Roosevelt the 26th. The legend states that Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States of America always kept with him a copy of the book, ``Euclid's Elements'' that he read at night by candle light.  The correct answer is b).  He said that it would make him a better lawyer.
