%Quartiles

2004-- In a quartile graph, data is plotted symmetrically on each side of the median. True or false?\\

Answer: False\\

Explanation:\\
In a quartile graph, data is not necessarily plotted symmetrically
on each side of the median. Despite the fact that the same number of
points is found on each side of the median, points will not
necessarily be placed symmetrically on each side of it.
